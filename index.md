## Most relevant projects

* [System information for a dentistry](https://github.com/JulianSalomon/Dentistware) (2016/07 – 2016/12)

    Web application developed using PHP language and CodeIgniter framework, for scheduling, registering and managing patients appointments and clinical histories of a dentistry. Developed by a four-man group, where my main contribution was visual and interactive teeth for fast and ease diagnostics using p5.js.

    Data structures visualizer developed using JavaScript with ANTLR and p5.js, allows the visualization of some Java’s native data structures such as: ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, PriorityQueue and some methods such as add, push, remove, among others. Developed by a two-man group, where I did most of the visualization of the structures.
